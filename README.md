# bootbot
scraping sites for a cheap pair of Red Wing boots

this script scrapes nordstrom rack for Red Wing products, and posts any new items to a kanboard card (which then gets emailed to me)

I would like to update this to scrape Sierra and only notify me in my sizes, but probably not worth it as I don't think it's going to take me long to find what I'm looking for.
